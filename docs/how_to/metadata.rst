Validation in Koda Validate naturally forms into graph structures -- usually
a tree (a notable exception would be the use of ``Lazy``). It is an
aim of this library to facilitate the re-purposing of such validation structures for other
purposes, such as documentation, customized error types, and so on (see Metadata for more
details).
